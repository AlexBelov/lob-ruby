Ruby wrapper for the [Lob.com](http://lob.com) API. See the full Lob.com [API Documentation](https://lob.com/docs/ruby).  For best results, be sure that you're using [the latest version](https://lob.com/docs/ruby#version) of the Lob API and the latest version of the ruby wrapper. This gem gives you an ActiveRecord-style syntax to use the Lob.com API.

Supports Ruby 1.9.3 and greater.

## Getting Started

Here's a general overview of the Lob services available, click through to read more.

- [Simple Postcard Service](https://lob.com/services/postcards)
- [Simple Letter Service](https://lob.com/services/letters)
- [Simple Check Service](https://lob.com/services/checks)
- [Simple Print Service](https://lob.com/services/sps)
- [Simple Area Mail](https://lob.com/services/sam)
- [Address Verification](https://lob.com/verification/address)

### Registration

First, you will need to first create an account at [Lob.com](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/register) and obtain your Test and Live API Keys.

Once you have created an account, you can access your API Keys from the [Settings Panel](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings).

### Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'lob'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or manually install it yourself:

    $ gem install lob

### Usage

The library uses an ActiveRecord-style interface. You'll feel right at home.

For optional parameters and other details, refer to the docs [here](https://lob.com/docs/ruby).

#### Initialization and Configuration

```ruby
# To initialize a Lob object
@lob = Lob.load(api_key: "your-api-key")

# Alternatively, to set the API key for all calls in the future
Lob.api_key = "your-api-key"
@lob = Lob.load
```

#### Or if you want some detailed configuration

```ruby
Lob.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "your-api-key"    # get your own at http://lob.com :)
  config.api_version = "2014-12-18"  # override the API version
end
```

#### Caution: Pass zero-prefixed zip codes as strings

When using zip codes with zero-prefixes, always quote them. For example when specifying `02125`, pass it as a string `"02125"`, instead of an integer.

The Ruby interpreter assumes it's not of base-10 and tries to convert it to base-10 number. So that might result in an entirely different zip-code than intended.

## Examples

We've provided various examples for you to try out [here](https://github.com/lob/lob-ruby/tree/master/examples).

There are simple scripts to demonstrate how to create all the core Lob products (checks, letters, postcards, jobs etc.), as well as more complex examples that utilize other libraries and external files:

## Contributing

    git clone https://github.com/lob/lob-ruby.git
    cd lob-ruby
    bundle install

### Contributing Instructions

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Make sure the tests pass
6. Open up coverage/index.html in your browser and add tests if required
7. Create new Pull Request

## Testing

Tests are written using MiniTest, a testing library that comes with Ruby stdlib.

You'll need to pass in your Lob.com API as the environment variable `LOB_API_KEY`, to run the tests. Be sure to use your Test API key, and not the Live one.

Here's how you can run the tests:

    LOB_API_KEY=your_test_api_key bundle exec rake test

You can also configure, TravisCI for your fork of the repository and it'll run the tests for you, when you push.
